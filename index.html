  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm <b>Mainak R. Chowdhury</b>, commonly known as <b>{{ site.common_username }}</b> 
  over the internet. I'm currently working as a <b>Junior Web Developer</b> at 
  a small company known as <b>Webguru Infosystems Pvt. Ltd</b>. Before that, 
  while I was a student, worked at a startup known as <b>Pedagoge</b>. My day 
  to day work involves <b>PHP</b> &amp; <b>NodeJS</b>, all though I'm keen to 
  learn &amp; love to work with front end technologies as well.</p>

  <p>Apart from my professional life, I'm a huge supporter of <b>Free &amp; Open 
  Source Software Movement</b>. Contributing to different open source projects 
  is my hobby. My contribution goes mainly to the Mozilla projects, simply 
  because they have the best open source community. Sometimes I wonder around 
  other communities as well.</p>

  <p>My field of interest includes but not limited to Dance, Photography(both 
  moving &amp; still), Movies &amp; Gardening. I love to wear jeans, eat tasty Indian 
  foods, listen to podcasts while traveling. <i class="fl-ubuntu-inverse"></i> 
  <b>Ubuntu MATE</b> is my primary OS. <b>Sublime Text</b> is the editor of 
  choice. Vim, spaces over tabs, ZSH(with Oh-my-ZSH) is how I define myself.</p>

  <p>Time to time I like to play with hardware &amp; build small things. Often 
  those small initiatives take shape of a full project. Few projects I'm proud 
  of so far,</p>

      which follows a line on a surface by collecting information using 
      sensors.</div>

      <div class="hidden">using a <b>Raspberry Pi</b> &amp; bunch of sensors. This
